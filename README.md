This bash script automates the installation of the Yoga version of OpenStack, a popular open-source cloud computing platform. The script installs several key OpenStack services, including Keystone (authentication and authorization), Glance (image management), Placement (resource allocation and management), Nova (compute), Neutron (networking), and Horizon (web-based dashboard).

The script also includes a "conf" directory that contains preconfigured config files for each service. If any changes are made to the variables in the script, it is important to reflect those changes in the config files. Additionally, the script includes "admin-openrc" and "demo-openrc" files which contain preconfigured credentials. If any changes are made to the credentials, these files should also be updated.

The script is designed to be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and can be downloaded and run using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
cd Bash-Script-for-OpenStack-Yoga-Installation
bash Yoga_Installation.sh
It's important to note that the script has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and it is recommended to use the same version of Ubuntu or another LTS version for the best compatibility.
